# Tinker's Satchel

A mod for Risk of Rain 2. Built with BepInEx and R2API.

Adds an artifact to the game which destroys items of you if you take damage but gives you many items

The main components are implemented by ThinkInvis in his Repository:
https://github.com/ThinkInvis/RoR2-TinkersSatchel

There are just changes to implement that artefact. So most of the credits belong to him.
